# Municipality Help System

## Overview

The **Municipality Help System** is a **Windows Forms Application** developed using **C#** and **.NET Framework**, designed to streamline the reporting of municipal issues, tracking service requests, and providing real-time community announcements. The system provides an intuitive, user-friendly interface that enables citizens to report issues efficiently while maintaining a structured backend to manage, categorize, and track submissions.  

The application emphasizes usability, accessibility, and a clean visual interface with color-coded sections, interactive navigation, and responsive feedback for users.

## Architecture

The system follows a **modular design pattern** with clear separation of concerns:

1. **Forms/UI Layer**
   - `Form1` – Main application form with navigation panel, welcome dashboard, announcements, and summary statistics.  
   - `ReportIssueForm` – Dedicated form for submitting new issues with a consistent theme and layout.  
   - `LocalEventsForm` – Displays events and municipal notices in a visually appealing, scrollable panel.  

2. **Models**
   - `IssueReport` – Represents an individual issue with properties such as `Location`, `Category`, `Description`, `MediaPath`, and `Timestamp`.  

3. **Data Structures**
   - `IssueLinkedList` – Custom linked list storing all submitted issues.  
   - `IssueQueue` – FIFO queue for pending issues to maintain order.  
   - `CategoryIndexBST` – BST keyed by issue category, containing linked list buckets for categorized issues.  

4. **Repository**
   - `IssueRepository` – Static class managing all issues and interacting with data structures to support efficient CRUD operations.
